# Baltic Training Services NVQ Marking Application
Bespoke application created for Baltic Training Services to speed up their NVQ assignment marking process.

Takes input from .txt files and the folder structure. Each folder represents an apprenticeship, and each .txt file within it contains the details for a single course within that apprenticeship. An example file is provided (000 - How To Use.txt).
    
Outputs to PDF using the iTextSharp library.
